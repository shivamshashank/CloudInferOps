There are many ways to contribute:

- **Report Bugs:** Open an issue if something doesn't work as expected.
- **Propose Features:** Suggest new capabilities, more alert rules, or
  additional dashboards.
- **Submit Pull Requests:** Improve the CLI, optimize Kubernetes configs, fix
  bugs, or expand documentation.
- **Improve Docs:** Clarify guides, fix typos, or add tutorials.

## 🛠️ Development Setup

CloudInferOps is written in **Go** and deploys resources using **Helm** and
**Kubernetes**.

### Prerequisites

To set up a local development environment, you will need:

- **Go** (version 1.21 or higher)
- **kubectl**
- **Helm**
- A local Kubernetes cluster for integration testing (e.g.,
  [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/), [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/),
  or [k3s](https://k3s.io/))
- **Multipass** (Highly recommended if you are developing on macOS, to easily
  simulate a Linux VM environment)

### Get the Code

1. Fork the CloudInferOps repository on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/CloudInferOps.git
   cd CloudInferOps
   ```
3. Add the upstream repository:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/shivamshashank/CloudInferOps.git
   ```
4. Install the pre-commit hooks to automatically lint your code:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup-hooks.sh
   ```

## 💻 Working on Code

### 1. Create a Branch

Always create a descriptive branch for your changes:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/bug-description
```

### 2. Make Your Changes

CloudInferOps follows a clean directory structure:

- `cmd/cloudinferops/`: The entry point for the Go command-line application.
- `internal/`: Subpackages representing core CLI commands, configurations,
  doctor checks, Helm logic, observability components, and alerts.
- `charts/`: The Helm charts bundled or managed by the CLI.
- `dashboards/`: Prebuilt Grafana JSON dashboards.

### 3. Formatting & Linting

Before committing, ensure your code complies with standard Go styling and lint
guidelines:

- **Format Code:**
  ```bash
  gofmt -w .
  ```
- **Run Vet:**
  ```bash
  go vet ./...
  ```
- **Run Linter:** (We use `golangci-lint`)
  ```bash
  golangci-lint run
  ```

### 4. Running Tests

We expect all code changes to be accompanied by appropriate unit tests or
integration tests:

- **Run all tests:**
  ```bash
  go test ./...
  ```
- **Run tests with coverage:**
  ```bash
  go test ./... -cover
  ```
- **Generate HTML coverage report:**
  ```bash
  go test ./... -coverprofile=coverage.out
  go tool cover -html=coverage.out
  ```
